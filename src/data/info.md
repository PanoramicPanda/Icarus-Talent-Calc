## What is Icarus and this site?

**Icarus** is a PvE-focused survival game set on a terraformed alien world. You descend to the surface, complete missions, gather resources, survive storms, and return before time runs out.

This site is a free, unofficial companion app built to help players:
- Plan their talent builds across Solo, Hunting, Resources, etc.
- Understand rank prerequisites and tree limitations
- Share builds with others via URLs

It runs entirely in your browser and works offline once loaded.
